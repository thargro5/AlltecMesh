# AlltecMesh
This is a repo for my senior design project named AlltecMesh an automated ground mesh assembly system. 
This repo contians all the code, prototypes, 3D prints.
The project integrates mechanical, and software components to create a semi-automated system for assembling copper ground meshes used in lightning protection systems. This repo includes code for embedded hardware control, Raspberry Pi-based scripting, and 3D-printable component files.

The system is designed to reduce manual labor and increase consistency in the fabrication of ground mesh grids. It automates the placement and alignment of copper wire into a defined configuration using actuators, sensors, and a visual LED guidance system.

Core features include:
	•	Arduino Nano 33 BLE for real-time motor and sensor control
	•	Raspberry Pi for GUI operation and higher-level coordination
	•	WS2812B LED strip for mesh layout guidance
	•	Stepper and DC motor control for wire advancement and positioning
	•	Custom 3D printed mounts and fixtures
